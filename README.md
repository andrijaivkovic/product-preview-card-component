## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS with SCSS syntax
- BEM Naming Convention

### What I learned

This was the first personal project where I used SASS to author my CSS. I also tried to follow the 7-1 SASS architecture as close as possible.
Other than practicing SASS, I practiced my CSS skills by building this project, specifically Flexbox.

### Continued development

In the future I plan to take more advantage of the tools that SASS provides.
